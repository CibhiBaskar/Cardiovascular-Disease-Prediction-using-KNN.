# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-using-KNN.
Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
Developed a Machine Learning model to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease in an individual. I retrieved the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and preprocessed it using pandas. Implemented the model using the KNN algorithm and got an accuracy score of 87%. Performed model evaluation by plotting a confusion matrix and found the promising F1-Score.
